# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection-python
This project detects the sleepy or drowsy driver by allotting a score and if the score exceeds then driver is alerted

# Project Information
This project aims to develop a real-time driver drowsiness detection system using OpenCV. The system will monitor a driver's face and detect signs of drowsiness, such as blinking or yawning, to enhance road safety by alerting the driver if signs of drowsiness are detected.

# Objectives:

Face Detection:
Use OpenCV to detect the driver's face in real-time using Haar Cascades or a pre-trained deep learning model.

Eye and Yawn Detection:
Detect eye blinks and yawns to assess drowsiness levels. This can be achieved using facial landmarks to analyze eye and mouth regions.

Real-Time Alerts:
Implement a system to provide alerts (visual or auditory) when drowsiness is detected to help the driver stay alert.

Libraries : 
opencv
face recognition
dlib
